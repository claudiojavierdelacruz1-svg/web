                <h3>How to Get to Malapascua</h3>
                <p>Malapascua is a small island north of Cebu, so the trip is done in several stages:</p>

                <h4>Getting to Cebu</h4>
                <p>Most travelers fly into Cebu International Airport (CEB), also known as Mactan-Cebu Airport.</p>

                <h4>From Cebu to Maya (North of Cebu)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bus:</strong> From the Cebu North Bus Terminal, you can take a direct bus to Maya Port (the boarding point for Malapascua). The journey takes approximately 3.5 to 5 hours.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Estimated price: 200 to 320 PHP (Philippine Pesos), depending on whether it's air-conditioned.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Van:</strong> They are a bit faster (about 4 hours) and also depart from the North Terminal.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Estimated price: around 350 PHP.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> It's best to leave early in the morning from Cebu to ensure you arrive in time for the last boat to Malapascua.</p>

                <h4>From Maya to Malapascua</h4>
                <p>At Maya port, you need to take a Bangga (traditional Filipino boat). The trip is short, about 30 minutes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Estimated price: 200 PHP for the ticket, plus a 120 PHP environmental fee.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Boats usually run until 4:30 PM - 5:00 PM. If the tide is low upon arrival in Malapascua, you may need to pay a small extra fee (about 20 PHP) to be taken to the shore in a smaller boat.</p>

            <section id="history">
                <h3>📜 History</h3>
                <p>The island's name has a curious Spanish origin: "Mala Pascua" literally means "Bad Easter" in Spanish (and in Cebuano).</p>
                <p>It is said that a group of Spanish sailors were stranded on the island due to a storm on December 25, 1520. Having spent the holiday in such adverse circumstances, they named the island with that name.</p>
                <p>Today, it is a quiet, rural municipality, part of the Visayan culture, known for its traditional fishing and warm hospitality.</p>

                <h3>🗓️ Best Time of Year to Go</h3>
                <p>The climate of Malapascua is divided into two main seasons, but the island is not as affected by rains as other areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dry Season (High):</strong> From November to June.
                        <ul>
                            <li>December to February: Considered the coolest and most pleasant months.</li>
                            <li>March to May: Very hot and dry.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wet Season (Low):</strong> From July to October.
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is more rain and risk of tropical storms or typhoons, especially between August and September. However, the rains are usually intermittent and do not ruin the trip.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip for divers:</strong> Visibility is generally good all year round, but the High Season (December to May) is considered the best for spotting the famous Thresher Shark.</p>
