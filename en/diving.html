            <h1>Diving on the island</h1>
            <p>Malapascua, a small island north of Cebu in the Philippines, is world-famous for being the only place on the planet where you can spot the elusive thresher shark with an almost guaranteed chance all year round. But beyond this iconic encounter, the island offers a brutal biodiversity that combines imposing pelagics with some of the best macro creatures in the Coral Triangle.</p>
            <p>Here is a guide on why you should dive into its waters and which spots you shouldn't miss in your logbook.</p>

            <h2>Why dive in Malapascua?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Thresher Shark (Alopias pelagicus):</strong> Unlike other places where encounters are accidental, here these sharks come daily to "cleaning stations" for small wrasses to remove their parasites.</p>
            <p><strong>Variety of ecosystems:</strong> In the same trip you can go from a tunnel under an island full of reef sharks to a muck diving session looking for pygmy seahorses.</p>
            <p><strong>Relaxed atmosphere:</strong> The island has no cars and is explored on foot. It is the ideal destination for those looking to disconnect from the world and connect with the ocean.</p>
            <p><strong>Diving for all levels:</strong> Although the thresher shark usually requires an Advanced Open Water certification (due to depth), there are spectacular sites for beginners and macro enthusiasts.</p>

            <h2>The best dives</h2>
            <h3>1. Monad Shoal and Kimud Shoal (The stars)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best:</strong> Thresher sharks and, occasionally, hammerhead sharks.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> Traditionally, Monad Shoal was the star site at dawn. However, Kimud Shoal has recently become very popular because thresher sharks are seen at shallower depths and for more hours of the day. Between December and April, Kimud is also the place to try and see schools of hammerhead sharks.</p>
            <h3>2. Gato Island (The marine sanctuary)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best:</strong> A 30-meter tunnel that crosses under the island.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> It is one of the most complete dives in the Philippines. Inside the tunnel, you will see white-tip sharks resting. Upon exiting, coral gardens full of sea snakes, nudibranchs, seahorses, and frogfish await you.</p>
            <h3>3. Lighthouse Reef (The mating ritual)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best:</strong> Mandarin fish.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> This is a sunset dive. The goal is to observe the complex and colorful mating dance of the mandarin fish. It is a fascinating visual spectacle for animal behavior lovers and macro photographers.</p>
            <h3>4. Lapus Lapus</h3>
            <p><strong>Best:</strong> Extreme macro and spectacular corals.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> An ideal site to find strange creatures like the giant frogfish, mantis shrimp, and an infinite variety of nudibranchs. Visibility is usually excellent and soft corals are very vibrant.</p>
            <h3>5. Kalanggaman Island (The postcard paradise)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best:</strong> Vertical walls and a dreamlike sandbar.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> Usually done as a full-day trip. The diving consists of deep walls covered with gorgonians and corals, with lots of reef life. The surface interval is spent on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.</p>

            <h2>Tips for responsible diving</h2>
            <p><strong>Maintain buoyancy:</strong> Malapascua's ecosystems are fragile. Avoid touching the coral or kicking up sediment, especially on macro dives.</p>
            <p><strong>Do not harass the sharks:</strong> At Monad and Kimud Shoal, strictly follow the guides' instructions. Do not swim towards the sharks; let them come to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Use reef-friendly sunscreen:</strong> Protect the reef by avoiding harmful chemicals that can damage marine life.</p>

            <h2>Practical data for your trip</h2>
            <p><strong>Best time:</strong> November to May (dry season). To see hammerhead sharks, aim for the months of February to April.</p>
            <p><strong>Water temperature:</strong> Between 26°C and 30°C. A 3mm suit is usually enough, although if you do many dives a day, you will appreciate some thermal protection.</p>
            <p><strong>Level required:</strong> Highly recommended to be Advanced Open Water to fully enjoy the thresher sharks (which are usually between 20 and 30 meters).</p>

            <h2>Preparation and gear</h2>
            <p><strong>Diving insurance:</strong> It is essential to have insurance that covers diving accidents and medical evacuation. Malapascua is a remote island and the nearest hyperbaric chamber is in Cebu.</p>
            <p><strong>Dive computer:</strong> Due to the multi-level nature of many dives, carrying your own computer will allow you to better manage your no-decompression limits.</p>
            <p><strong>Torch for night dives:</strong> Don't miss the Lighthouse Reef dive or the night dives at the harbor; a good torch is essential to appreciate the real colors underwater.</p>
