            <h1>Diving on the island</h1>
            <p>Malapascua, a small island north of Cebu in the Philippines, is world-famous for being the only place on the planet where you can spot the elusive thresher shark almost guaranteed throughout the year. But beyond this iconic encounter, the island offers a brutal biodiversity that combines impressive pelagics with some of the best macro creatures in the Coral Triangle.</p>
            <p>Here is a guide to why you should dive into its waters and which spots should not be missing from your logbook.</p>
            <h2>Why dive in Malapascua?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Thresher Shark (Alopias pelagicus):</strong> Unlike other places where encounters are fortuitous, here these sharks come daily to "cleaning stations" for small wrasses to remove their parasites.</p>
            <p><strong>Variety of ecosystems:</strong> In a single trip, you can go from a tunnel under an island full of reef sharks to a muck diving session looking for pygmy seahorses.</p>
            <p><strong>Relaxed atmosphere:</strong> The island has no cars and is explored on foot. It is the ideal destination for those looking to disconnect from the world and connect with the ocean.</p>
            <p><strong>Diving for all levels:</strong> Although the thresher shark usually requires an Advanced Open Water certification (due to the depth), there are spectacular sites for beginners and macro enthusiasts.</p>
            <h2>The best dives</h2>
            <h3>1. Monad Shoal and Kimud Shoal (The stars)</h3>
            <p><strong>The best:</strong> Thresher sharks and, occasionally, hammerhead sharks.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> Traditionally, Monad Shoal was the star site at dawn. However, recently Kimud Shoal has become very popular because thresher sharks are seen at a shallower depth and for more hours of the day. Between December and April, Kimud is also the place to try to see schools of hammerhead sharks.</p>
            <h3>2. Gato Island (The marine sanctuary)</h3>
            <p><strong>The best:</strong> A 30-meter tunnel that runs under the island.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> It is one of the most complete dives in the Philippines. Inside the tunnel, you will see whitetip reef sharks resting. When you come out, coral gardens full of sea snakes, nudibranchs, seahorses, and frogfish await you.</p>
            <h3>3. Lighthouse Reef (The mating ritual)</h3>
            <p><strong>The best:</strong> Mandarinfish.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> It is a dive that is done at sunset. The goal is to observe the complex and colorful mating dance of the mandarinfish. It is a fascinating visual spectacle for lovers of animal behavior and macro photography.</p>
            <h3>4. Lapus Lapus</h3>
            <p><strong>The best:</strong> Extreme macro and spectacular corals.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> An ideal site to find strange creatures such as the giant frogfish, mantis shrimp, and an infinite variety of nudibranchs. The visibility is usually excellent and the soft corals are very vibrant.</p>
            <h3>5. Kalanggaman Island (The picture-perfect paradise)</h3>
            <p><strong>The best:</strong> Vertical walls and a dreamy sandbar.</p>
            <p><strong>The experience:</strong> It is usually done as a full-day excursion. The dive consists of deep walls covered with gorgonians and corals, with a lot of reef life. The surface interval is done on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.</p>
            <h2>Practical data for your trip</h2>
            <p><strong>Best time:</strong> From November to May (dry season). To see hammerhead sharks, aim for the months of February to April.</p>
            <p><strong>Water temperature:</strong> Between 26°C and 30°C. A 3mm suit is usually enough, although if you do many dives a day, you will appreciate some thermal protection.</p>
            <p><strong>Required level:</strong> It is highly recommended to be an Advanced Open Water diver to fully enjoy the thresher sharks (which are usually between 20 and 30 meters deep).</p>
